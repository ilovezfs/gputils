GPUTILS EXTRAS 
==============

This package provides extra information for gputils users that is beyond the
scope of the gputils package itself.  The intent is to provide a repository
for sourcefiles, standard nonprocessor include files, and tools generated 
by gputils users.  

It is not the intent to redistribute information which is already available
from another source.  Although, this may be necessary in some cases.  

The contents of this package were not necessarily generated by the gputils 
developers or administrators.  They are, however, the final authority on what
is included and how it is included. 

Anything contributed to this package will be covered by the GPL license.

GUIDELINES
==========

These guidelines shall be followed by anyone contributing a file to gputils
extras.  The goal of these guidelines is not to force people to adhere to 
arbitrary rules, but to provide a uniform set of files. I know that there are 
many special cases which are not covered by this document.  In those cases, 
please adhere to the spirit of this document if not the letter.  

General:

1.  Licensing restrictions and copyrights shall be observed on all
    contributions.  This mainly applies to files which are contributed
    by a person other than the author. 
2.  All files shall use unix format. No DOS style CRLF newlines.
3.  No line shall exceed 78 characters.
4.  No tab characters shall be used.
5.  The filenames must be lower case alphanumeric characters, underscores("_"),
    and periods (".").
6.  The natural language of the package is English.


PIC Code:

1.  Only assembly source files shall be distributed.  No hex files.
2.  Files shall use syntax which is compatible with gputils.
3.  No High level language source code will be distributed.
4.  All reserved words must be in lower case. (movlw, fill)
5.  .inc extension shall be reserved for files with definitions only. These 
    files should only contain equs and #defines.
6.  .asm extension shall be reserved for files with machine code.  These files
    can be relocatable or non relocatable.  
7.  Unless you are writing a new example, keep the functions general.  Try not
    to write the complete source code for one specific application.  Format 
    the files to maximize reuse.

Tools:

1.  No tool binaries shall be included in the gputils-extras source distributed.
2.  All tools shall be portable.
3.  All scripts shall be sh-compatible.  No DOS batch files. 

This list is bound to grow.  Suggestions are encouraged.  

Categories
==========

Try to fit your source into one of the following categories.  If you think a
category is missing, let me know.

  /data           - Data that doesn't fit into any other category.
  /examples       - Complete projects whose purpose is to demonstrate how
                    gputils works.
  /src            - Source code to be included, linked, or otherwise used to 
                    create new projects.
    /flow         - program flow, tests, ...
    /header       - header files
    /io           - input and output functions
    /int          - interrupts
    /math         - math routines, floating and integer
    /memory       - memory operations
    /time         - timing functions such as PWM
  /tools          - tools to aid in the development of source code


Templates
=========

In the future, templates will be generated to reduce the amount of work
required to make a contribution.  Until then, use your best judgment.
