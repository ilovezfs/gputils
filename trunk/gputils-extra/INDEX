Here are some routines to handle flags or boolean variables. Each byte in RAM 
can store 8 flags, and this routines lets you to set, clear, or look at any 
flag stored there, and also count how many variables are set, and clear or 
set all flags. If you want to use it, you only have to define FLAGS_NUM, which 
is the number of flags you need. Each flag is located with an identifier. First
byte contains flags 0 to 7, and so on...

For example, if you want to use a flag called FLAG1, you should declare 
something like:

#define FLAG1 0  ; this is the identifier of this flag.

And use FLAG1 when calling any of these routines.

Here are some routines to match strings received from serial communications or
other routines.  Known strings are stored in program memory, thus saving RAM 
locations. These routines let you to check a string while you are receiving it,
and return an identifier for the received string, if it's known. The main 
limitation is that there should be enough time between receiving two characters,
so the routine could finish. This shouldn't be a problem in micros with USART, 
but must be taken into account in micros without it.

This routines require some flags handling routines, which you could find in
/src/memory/flags.asm.
