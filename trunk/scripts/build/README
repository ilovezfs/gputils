gputils scripts
===============

This directory contains scripts for maintaining gputils.  

make-mingw - Build a binary mingw32 gputils distribution.

 
1.0 make-mingw
==============

This script provides an automated method for generating a binary mingw 
distribution of gputils.  The distribution is built using a cross compiler on 
a linux system.  Some of the variables may have to be changed when a new
maintainer takes over.

1.1 Script Options
==================

The script has many options.  To review the script options run "./make-mingw
--help". Typically, the only option required is to specify the source archive.

./make-mingw --source=gputils-0.10.0.tar.gz

Additionally, the builder of the script should specify their name and email
address.  That can be accomplished by setting the environmental variables as 
shown in the table below:
 
VARIABLE  	DESCRIPTION			EXAMPLE
--------        -----------                     -------
NAME		Name of the Packager		Craig Franklin
EMAIL		Email address of Packager	<craigfranklin@attbi.com>

These variable may also be specified by options to the script (--name="Craig 
Franklin")

1.2  Patches
============

Any patch applied to the source must be provided with the distribution.  Specify
the patch using --patch="file name".

The patches should be in unified format.  They should also not be compressed. To
work, the scripts must be generated from the directory containing the base
gputils directory name.  An example of how to generate the patch is shown below:

diff -ur gputils-0.10.0.orig gputils-0.10.0 > mypatch.diff

In this case "--patch=mypatch.diff" would be added to the make-mingw arguments.
