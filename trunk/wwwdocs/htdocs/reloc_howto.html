<H1>GPUTILS Relocatable Object HowTo</H1>
<P><A HREF="mailto:craigfranklin@comcast.net">Craig Franklin</A></P>
<P>May 3, 2004</P>
<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>This is a quick description of how to use gputils to generate
relocatable objects and how to link those objects to generate an
executable. This document is very brief. It is no substitute for the
<A HREF="http://gputils.sourceforge.net/33014g.pdf">Microchip
document</A>.</P>
<P>This information will be incorporated into the gputils manual at
some point in the future.</P>
<H2>2. What are relocatable objects?</H2>
<P>They are files which contain machine code, symbols, and relocation
information. The relocation information allows the file to be placed
&quot;anywhere&quot; in memory. gputils uses Common Object File
Format (COFF). A good book describing COFF is &quot;Understanding and
Using COFF&quot; by Gircys. It is out of print, but you can still buy
used copies. gputils users shouldn't need the book, but the
developers might.</P>
<H2>3. How are they used?</H2>
<P>The code is assembled into a COFF. After all the code is compiled,
the coff are input into the linker. Symbols are resolved, addresses
are assigned, and the machine code is patched with the new addresses.
The output from the linker is an absolute executable object.</P>
<H2>4. Why relocatable objects?</H2>
<P>Most development tools create then link relocatable objects to
generate an executable. The exception is some tools for
microcontrollers. The applications are relatively small so creating
one big file isn't impractical.</P>
<P>Using relocatable objects does have advantages:</P>
<ol>
<li>Files can have local name spaces. The user chooses what symbols
are global.</li>
<li>Code can be written without regard to addresses. This makes it
easier to write and reuse.</li>
<li>The objects can be archived to create a library, which also
simplifies reuse.</li>
<li>Recompiling a project can be faster, because you only compile
the portions that have changed.</li>
</ol>
<P>For PICs, it has one big disadvantage. The bank and page control
is a challenge.</P>

<H2>5. Generating objects</H2>
<P>You are interested in data memory and program memory. In absolute
code, you have orgs to assign the start address of program memory and
cblock to generate a block of data memory. In relocatable code,
program memory is created using the code directive and uninitialized
data memory using udata.</P>
<P>Take a look at the following code segment:</P>
<pre>
	processor 16f877
	include &quot;p16f877.inc&quot;

	udata
mem1	res	1
mem2	res	2
mem3	res	1
; symbols from other modules

	extern	_main

	code
_init
	banksel	mem1
	movlw	0
	movwf	mem1
	movwf	mem2
	movwf	mem2 + 1
	movwf	mem3
	pagesel	_main
	goto	_main
; global symbols in this module
	global	mem1
	global	mem2
	global	_init
	end
</pre>

<P>4 bytes of uninitialized data are reserved. A code segment to
initialize the data starts at symbol _init. Once complete the code
branches to _main. Mem1 and mem2 are global file registers. mem3 is
static, which is a waste considering it is only initialized and never
used.</P>
<P>This file would be assembled by gpasm:</P>
<pre>
gpasm -c init.asm
</pre>
gpasm would output a COFF, init.o.

<P>You can assign the section address in the assembler by adding an
address to the section directive (udata or code). This is not
recomended. You don't want to assign the address at assembly time,
that would defeat the purpose.</P>
<pre>
	code	0x100
_init
	banksel	mem1
	movlw	0
	movwf	mem1
	movwf	mem2
	movwf	mem2 + 1
	movwf	mem3
	pagesel	_main
	goto	_main
</pre>
<P>Multiple sections can exist in the same file, but they must have
different names. The section name proceeds the section directive. If
no name is provided a default name is used.</P>
<pre>
	code
_init
	banksel	mem1
	movlw	0
	movwf	mem1
	movwf	mem2
	movwf	mem2 + 1
	movwf	mem3
	pagesel	_main
	goto	_main

mycode	code
	banksel	mem1
	incf	mem1, f
</pre>
<P>Other types of sections exist, it is beyond the scope of this
document to describe them all. See the document in the intro for a
more detailed description.</P>
<H2>6. Viewing objects</H2>
<P>gpvo is a tool for viewing objects. If you are interested in
seeing how things work, use it.</P>
<pre>
gpvo init.o | less
</pre>
<H2>7. Linking objects</H2>
<P>So you have assembled several objects and now you need to make a
COD file for simulation and a hex file for programming. gplink takes
care of this.</P>
<P>gplink only requires the objects and a linker script to build the
required output files. A set of scripts are included in
/usr/share/gputils/lkr. These scripts were generated by Microchip.
They were intended to cutomized by the user, but for many
applications they can work as is.</P>
<P>Commanding:</P>
<pre>
gplink -m -c -s /usr/share/gputils/lkr/16f877.lkr main.o init.o isr.o
</pre>
<P>Will result in a map file (-m) to be output. This file contains
the final addresses assigned to the data and program memory. An
executable coff (-c) that is good for reference and simulation in
MPLAB. Also a set of output files a.hex and a.cod. The default base
filename is &quot;a&quot;. It is best to specify your own output name
using &quot;-o&quot;.</P>
<P>In the future the path to the scripts will be added, just like the
path to the headers for gpasm. For now, use the full path or copy the
file to your working directory.</P>
<H2>8. Simulating the executable</H2>
<P>Gplink outputs a COD file that is compatible with <A HREF="http://www.dattalo.com/gnupic/gpsim.html">gpsim</A>.
Gpsim will generate a few new warnings. One will be about not finding
a list file. Others may be generated about not using gpasm. These
warnings can be ignored. They will be fixed in a future release of
gpsim.</P>
<H2>9. Creating Libraries</H2>
<P>If you have a collection of objects they can be combined into one
archive. The archive is a convient way to link an application against
a common library. The tool is gplib. It is very easy to use.</P>
<pre>
gplib -c math.a mult.o add.o sub.o exp.o
</pre>
<P>Creates a new archive math.a. The name is arbitary. It could be
called &quot;math.lib&quot; or &quot;math&quot;. gputils doesn't use
file extensions to determine file types.</P>
<P>Then when you link the application add math.a to the list of
objects</P>
<pre>
gplink -m -c -s /usr/share/gputils/lkr/16f877.lkr main.o init.o isr.o math.a
</pre>
<P>gplink will only extract those archive members that are required
to resolve external references. So the application won't necessarily
contain the code of all the archive members.</P>
<H2>10. Makefiles</H2>
<P>Here is one of the Makefiles I have been working with. It can be a
template for you:</P>
<pre>
SCRIPT = 16f877.lkr
OBJECTS = main.o startup.o isr.o i2c.o
OUTPUT = example.hex

all:		$(OUTPUT)

$(OUTPUT):	$(OBJECTS) $(SCRIPT)
	gplink --map -c -s $(SCRIPT) -o $(OUTPUT) $(OBJECTS)

%.o:		%.asm
	gpasm -c $&lt;

clean:
	rm -f *.o *.lst *.map *.hex

i2c.o:		i2c.asm common.inc

isr.o:		isr.asm common.inc

main.o:		main.asm common.inc

startup.o:	startup.asm common.inc
</pre>
<H2>11. The Future</H2>
<P>There are many features that are planned. Linker
optimizations, assembler extensions for high level languages. ...</P>
<P>I will try to keep this document updated. Please send me your
comments and questions.</P>
