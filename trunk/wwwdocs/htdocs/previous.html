            The path to the header files is automatically loaded into the
            include paths list. This means that you no longer need to add "-I
            /usr/local/share/gpasm/header" to gpasm to use the provided header
            files. This feature can be disabled by adding "--disable-path" when
            configuring. One key point, gpasm always checks the local directory
            for includes before checking any of the include paths.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fill directive will now allow a line of assembly as an
            argument. The argument must be enclosed by parentheses.

          <p>
            Several bugs were fixed in the lexer. These were related to
            malformed input files confusing gpasm about when pass 1 could be
            ended. One of the file problems was a missing newline before the
            end of file marker. The bugs have been fixed so they shouldn't
            cause any more problems. Gpasm will warn the user when one of these
            files is processed. If you receive the warning, open the input file
            in vi and save it. Vi will fix the problem. The test has been
            disabled on win32 systems because of inconsistencies in the editors
            and file formats.

          </p>
          <p>
            A new feature is "list n=0". This will prevent page breaks in the
            source code section of the list file. A related bug was also fixed.
            All numeric arguments to the list directive are now interpretted as
            decimal regardless of the current radix setting.

            <b>September 8, 2001 -- v0.9.12 Released</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This release makes more improvements to the preprocessor. A brief
            description of the features are in the ChangeLog. A more
            comprehensive explaination will be included in the updated
            documentation in the next minor release.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the new features, several bug fixes were
            incorporated. The most significant was the replacement of the old
            "can't evaluate expression" error message with more meaningful
            messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was surprised to see that more than 400 people downloaded the
            MinGW32 port of gpasm 0.9.11. No one has reported any bugs in the
            port. Because of the large number of downloads, the MinGW32
            distribution will continue to be generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            More progress was made with the new macro implementation. With
            these changes all of the known macro defiencies have been fixed.
            These changes will be distributed in the next minor release (there
            might be a couple more micros releases first).

            This release primarily fixes bugs and adds features to the gpasm
            preprocessor. This is all ground work for the up coming macro
            implementation changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the changes in this release, gpasm should correctly identify
            any opcode, directive, or macro incorrectly placed in column 1. It
            will also substitute any symbol found in column 1 that appears in
            the #defines table.

          </p>
          <p>
            A gpasm user has decided to attempt a gpasm port to win32 using
            Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. To my knowledge this has never been
            attempted. I have done this using the Borland compiler. In order to
            help the user, the data from the Borland port has been added. The
            data is available in the "What Platforms are Supported?" section of
            this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Borland data will be added to the distribution sometime in the
            future. If Visual C port works that data could be added as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try out the Borland port. If you have an opinion send me an email

            I experienced a moment of terror on July 29<sup>th</sup>, when my
            new 0.9.9 release generated a core dump. I made the 0.9.9 release
            inactive and investigated the problem. It turned out to be a really
            old bug. I had already stopped the presses, so I decided to just
            make a new release that included the fix.
          </p>

            <b>July 28, 2001 -- v0.9.9 Released</b>

          <p>
            This release fixes some minor bugs and cleans up some of the old
            code. Most of the changes probably won't effect users who are not
            writing new code. For those that are, several new tests should help
            to catch some problems before they occur. For example, all labels
            are checked to see if they are a resevered word. If they are a
            warning is generated and the text is treated accordingly. This test
            should help catch typos.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>July 17, 2001 -- v0.9.8 Released</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            gpasm will now expand macros in the listing and cod files. The real
            advantage of this is gpsim will jump to the macro or while loop
            source when stepping through the code. If you like the old way that
            gpasm operated add a "NOEXPAND" or "LIST x=OFF" to the top of your
            source code. Another way is to add the argument "e=OFF" to gpasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            New with this release is an optional i386 rpm distribution. Make
            sure you uninstall any previous gpasm installation before
            installing the rpm. This can be accomplished by running a "make
            uninstall" on 0.9.7 or by removing the binaries from /usr/local/bin
            and the data from /usr/local/share/gpasm. The only difference the
            users should notice is the headers are now located in
            /usr/share/gpasm/header.

            This one has some new features. New operators have been
            implemented. i++, i--, i+=1 are some examples.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also some new eye candy in this one as well. A memory map
            is now produced as part of the list file. The number of program
            words used by the file is also reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some work was done to make gpasm a little more friendly to non
            Linux systems. More can probably be done in this area. If you have
            to patch gpasm to compile it, please send me the data. I will
            evaluate it for possible inclusion in future gpasm releases
            &lt;craigfranklin@users.sourceforge.net&gt;.

          <p>
            This release primarily fixes bugs submitted into the bug tracker.
            Most of them are minor. The one some of you may have experienced is
            failure of 0.9.5 to compile due to missing getopt_long(). This
            problem occurs on Solaris and some BSDs. This version of gpasm will
            configure around your system. If you don't have it, gpasm won't use
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version of the object file viewer is included in this
            release. It is not a final version. Please hold off on the bug
            reports for a few weeks at least. The basic functions of the viewer
            work, but there are still some holes to fill. Completion of this
            viewer will lead directly into object file generation for gpasm.

          </p>
          <p>
            The release was completed on May 13th, so this is probably old news
            for many of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much was accomplished, but nothing that I planned for. The main
            changes are related to getting some case sensitivity problems
            solved. The problem was that the mneumonics in special.inc are
            implemented as macros. This created some case sensitivity
            headaches. This release solves all of the problems (at least the
            ones I know about).
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution was to move the functionality of special.inc into the
            source code. With 0.9.5 you can safely remove special.inc from
            /usr/local/share/gpasm. This can also be accomplished be running a
            "make uninstall" on 0.9.4 before installing 0.9.5.
          </p>
          <p>
            The macro expansion and object file viewer are in about the same
            shape they were a couple of weeks ago. They are still at the top of
            the list. I will try to make finish them for the next release. I
            won't make any promises though.

            Many things are in the queue for 0.9.5. Most are very close to

            I have spent most of the last week working on the Microchip test
            files. They provided &gt; 500 asm files for testing MPASM. The
            first time I tested gpasm, only 53 of the files passed. With the
            changes made in 0.9.2 we are up to 387. Not 500, but much better
            than 53. The rest of the 0.9.x series will concentrate on getting
            closer to 500 files passing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The linker support was put on hold when the Microchip test files
            came in. I felt it was better to fix bugs than to add features. Not
            to worry, I will pick it back up in a few weeks. Currently, the
            linker can read Microchip's object files and combine the data into
            one hex file. (All of the important steps in between are skipped.)
