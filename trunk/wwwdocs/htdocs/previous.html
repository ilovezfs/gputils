			<P>This release primarily fixes bugs in gpasm.</P>
			<P><B>May 12, 2002 -- gputils-0.10.3 Released and
			gputils-extra-0.0.2 Released</B> 
			</P>
			<P>At the request of a user, man pages have been generated for
			gputils. These pages are not considered a substitute for the
			manual. The header files and linker scripts have been updated.
			Changes were incorporated for the Code Warrior port of gpasm.</P>
			<P>A new branch in cvs has been created for the relocatable object
			file support. This branch will become 0.10.4 or 0.10.5. A notice
			will be posted when it is ready for the users. 
			</P>
			<P><B>April 4, 2002 -- gputils-0.10.2 Released</B></P>
			<P>gpasm now generates messages, warnings, and errors for various
			invalid arguments to instructions. Typically because the argument
			is not within the valid range. Additionally, gpasm now generates
			messages and warnings related to setting the bank and page bits.</P>
			<P><B>February 24, 2002 -- gputils-0.10.1 Released</B></P>
			<P>This release includes a major overhaul of macros. The macros
			are now stored as text instead of a parsed structure. This text is
			inputted into the lexer each time the macro is called. Several
			macro related problems were also fixed.</P>
			<P><B>January 24, 2002 -- gputils-extra-0.0.1 Released</B></P>
			<P>The is the first release of the new extras package. Anything
			which doesn't fit into gputils will go into this new package. The
			package is distributed in source only and does not install.</P>
			<P><B>January 20, 2002 -- gputils-0.10.0 Released</B> 
			</P>
			<P>This release is basically gpasm-0.9.14 with bug fixes.
			Additionally, there are some new tools. However, these new tools
			are not complete, so they are not installed. Please see the
			ChangeLog for details on the bug fixes. 
			</P>
			<P><B>January 13, 2002 -- gputils imported to cvs </B>
			</P>
			<P>The new package has been imported to cvs. The first release
			should occur in the coming weeks. 
			</P>
			<P><B>December 12, 2001 -- gputils package created </B>
			</P>
			<P>A new linker and lib tool are under development. These new
			tools along with gpasm will be distributed in a new package
			gputils, GNU PIC Utilities.</P>
			<P><B>November 20, 2001 -- gpasm-extra announced</B></P>
			<P>A new package, gpasm-extra, is being put together. See the
			description above for details.</P>
			<P><B>October 31, 2001 -- v0.9.14 Released</B></P>
			<P>The path to the header files is automatically loaded into the
			include paths list. This means that you no longer need to add &quot;-I
			/usr/local/share/gpasm/header&quot; to gpasm to use the provided
			header files. This feature can be disabled by adding
			&quot;--disable-path&quot; when configuring. One key point, gpasm
			always checks the local directory for includes before checking any
			of the include paths.</P>
			<P>The fill directive will now allow a line of assembly as an
			argument. The argument must be enclosed by parentheses.</P>
			<P>fill (goto start), NextBlock - $</P>
			<P>Several bugs were fixed in the lexer. These were related to
			malformed input files confusing gpasm about when pass 1 could be
			ended. One of the file problems was a missing newline before the
			end of file marker. The bugs have been fixed so they shouldn't
			cause any more problems. Gpasm will warn the user when one of
			these files is processed. If you receive the warning, open the
			input file in vi and save it. Vi will fix the problem. The test
			has been disabled on win32 systems because of inconsistencies in
			the editors and file formats.</P>
			<P><B>October 6, 2001 -- v0.9.13 Released</B></P>
			<P>The release is mainly to add several new processors.
			Additionally, new header files to support the processors were
			added.</P>
			<P>A new feature is &quot;list n=0&quot;. This will prevent page
			breaks in the source code section of the list file. A related bug
			was also fixed. All numeric arguments to the list directive are
			now interpretted as decimal regardless of the current radix
			setting.</P>
			<P><B>September 8, 2001 -- v0.9.12 Released</B></P>
			<P>This release makes more improvements to the preprocessor. A
			brief description of the features are in the ChangeLog. A more
			comprehensive explaination will be included in the updated
			documentation in the next minor release.</P>
			<P>In addition to the new features, several bug fixes were
			incorporated. The most significant was the replacement of the old
			&quot;can't evaluate expression&quot; error message with more
			meaningful messages.</P>
			<P>I was surprised to see that more than 400 people downloaded the
			MinGW32 port of gpasm 0.9.11. No one has reported any bugs in the
			port. Because of the large number of downloads, the MinGW32
			distribution will continue to be generated.</P>
			<P>More progress was made with the new macro implementation. With
			these changes all of the known macro defiencies have been fixed.
			These changes will be distributed in the next minor release (there
			might be a couple more micros releases first). 
			</P>
			<P><B>August 17, 2001 -- MinGW32 binary</B></P>
			<P>For the next few releases a win32 binary will be provided. If
			this distribution is popular the releases will continue. 
			</P>
			<P><B>August 14, 2001 -- v0.9.11 Released</B></P>
			<P>This release primarily fixes bugs and adds features to the
			gpasm preprocessor. This is all ground work for the up coming
			macro implementation changes. 
			</P>
			<P>With the changes in this release, gpasm should correctly
			identify any opcode, directive, or macro incorrectly placed in
			column 1. It will also substitute any symbol found in column 1
			that appears in the #defines table. 
			</P>
			<P><B>August 4, 2001 -- v0.9.10 for win32 experiment</B></P>
			<P>A gpasm user has decided to attempt a gpasm port to win32 using
			Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. To my knowledge this has never been
			attempted. I have done this using the Borland compiler. In order
			to help the user, the data from the Borland port has been added.
			The data is available in the &quot;What Platforms are Supported?&quot;
			section of this page. 
			</P>
			<P>The Borland data will be added to the distribution sometime in
			the future. If Visual C port works that data could be added as
			well. 
			</P>
			<P>Try out the Borland port. If you have an opinion send me an
			email &lt;craigfranklin@users.sourceforge.net&gt;.</P>
			<P><B>July 30, 2001 -- v0.9.10 Released</B></P>
			<P>I experienced a moment of terror on July 29<SUP>th</SUP>, when
			my new 0.9.9 release generated a core dump. I made the 0.9.9
			release inactive and investigated the problem. It turned out to be
			a really old bug. I had already stopped the presses, so I decided
			to just make a new release that included the fix.</P>
			<P><B>July 28, 2001 -- v0.9.9 Released</B></P>
			<P>This release fixes some minor bugs and cleans up some of the
			old code. Most of the changes probably won't effect users who are
			not writing new code. For those that are, several new tests should
			help to catch some problems before they occur. For example, all
			labels are checked to see if they are a resevered word. If they
			are a warning is generated and the text is treated accordingly.
			This test should help catch typos.</P>
			<P><B>July 17, 2001 -- v0.9.8 Released</B></P>
			<P>gpasm will now expand macros in the listing and cod files. The
			real advantage of this is gpsim will jump to the macro or while
			loop source when stepping through the code. If you like the old
			way that gpasm operated add a &quot;NOEXPAND&quot; or &quot;LIST
			x=OFF&quot; to the top of your source code. Another way is to add
			the argument &quot;e=OFF&quot; to gpasm.</P>
			<P>New with this release is an optional i386 rpm distribution.
			Make sure you uninstall any previous gpasm installation before
			installing the rpm. This can be accomplished by running a &quot;make
			uninstall&quot; on 0.9.7 or by removing the binaries from
			/usr/local/bin and the data from /usr/local/share/gpasm. The only
			difference the users should notice is the headers are now located
			in /usr/share/gpasm/header.</P>
			<P><B>June 17, 2001 -- v0.9.7 Released</B></P>
			<P>This one has some new features. New operators have been
			implemented. i++, i--, i+=1 are some examples.</P>
			<P>There is also some new eye candy in this one as well. A memory
			map is now produced as part of the list file. The number of
			program words used by the file is also reported.</P>
			<P>Some work was done to make gpasm a little more friendly to non
			Linux systems. More can probably be done in this area. If you have
			to patch gpasm to compile it, please send me the data. I will
			evaluate it for possible inclusion in future gpasm releases
			&lt;craigfranklin@users.sourceforge.net&gt;. 
			</P>
			<P><B>May 30, 2001 -- v0.9.6 Released</B></P>
			<P>This release primarily fixes bugs submitted into the bug
			tracker. Most of them are minor. The one some of you may have
			experienced is failure of 0.9.5 to compile due to missing
			getopt_long(). This problem occurs on Solaris and some BSDs. This
			version of gpasm will configure around your system. If you don't
			have it, gpasm won't use it. 
			</P>
			<P>The first version of the object file viewer is included in this
			release. It is not a final version. Please hold off on the bug
			reports for a few weeks at least. The basic functions of the
			viewer work, but there are still some holes to fill. Completion of
			this viewer will lead directly into object file generation for
			gpasm.</P>
			<P><B>May 18, 2001 -- v0.9.5 Released</B></P>
			<P>The release was completed on May 13th, so this is probably old
			news for many of you.</P>
			<P>Much was accomplished, but nothing that I planned for. The main
			changes are related to getting some case sensitivity problems
			solved. The problem was that the mneumonics in special.inc are
			implemented as macros. This created some case sensitivity
			headaches. This release solves all of the problems (at least the
			ones I know about). 
			</P>
			<P>The solution was to move the functionality of special.inc into
			the source code. With 0.9.5 you can safely remove special.inc from
			/usr/local/share/gpasm. This can also be accomplished be running a
			&quot;make uninstall&quot; on 0.9.4 before installing 0.9.5. 
			</P>
			<P>The macro expansion and object file viewer are in about the
			same shape they were a couple of weeks ago. They are still at the
			top of the list. I will try to make finish them for the next
			release. I won't make any promises though. 
			</P>
			<P><B>April 22, 2001 -- v0.9.4 Released</B></P>
			<P>More compatibility changes ... most are minor. 460 of 501 gpasm
			test files are now passing. 
			</P>
			<P>Many things are in the queue for 0.9.5. Most are very close to
			being complete, but weren't ready to make the 0.9.4 cut. These
			things include: 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P>A utility to view the contents of Microchip's object
				files. The next step in adding object file support to gpasm.</P>
				<LI><P>Macro expansion. It has been on the back burner for some
				time. I just want to get it off of my &quot;To Do&quot; list.</P>
			</UL>
			<P><B>March 17, 2001 -- v0.9.3 Released</B></P>
			<P>The work has continued on the Microchip test files. 431 of 501
			gpasm test files are now passing. 
			</P>
			<P><B>March 4, 2001 -- v0.9.2 Released</B></P>
			<P>I have spent most of the last week working on the Microchip
			test files. They provided &gt; 500 asm files for testing MPASM.
			The first time I tested gpasm, only 53 of the files passed. With
			the changes made in 0.9.2 we are up to 387. Not 500, but much
			better than 53. The rest of the 0.9.x series will concentrate on
			getting closer to 500 files passing.</P>
			<P>The linker support was put on hold when the Microchip test
			files came in. I felt it was better to fix bugs than to add
			features. Not to worry, I will pick it back up in a few weeks.
			Currently, the linker can read Microchip's object files and
			combine the data into one hex file. (All of the important steps in
			between are skipped.) 
			</P>
			<P><A HREF="mailto:cnieves@iname.com"><FONT SIZE=3>Carlos Nieves</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=3>
			has provided a patch which adds the 17cxx family. It will be part
			of 0.9.3.</FONT></P>
