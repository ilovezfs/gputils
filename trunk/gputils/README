This is a collection of development tools for Microchip (TM) PIC (TM) 
microcontrollers.

Gputils implements a subset of features available with Microchip's tools.
See the documentation for an up-to-date list of what gputils can do.

Installation instructions are constained in the INSTALL document.

Documentation is in the "doc" directory.  The user manual is
"gputils.lyx", it's ready for a postscript printer as "gputils.ps" or
viewing using Adobe (TM) Acrobat (TM) as "gputils.pdf".  Lyx is
available from http://www.lyx.org

Send any bug reports to the bug tracking system at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/gputils/

Please verify a bug report has not already been submitted before creating a
new one.  In the report, please state which version of gputils you're using, 
the machine and OS you've built it for (or not), and enough source code to 
reproduce the problem.

If you're trying to build gputils on a machine/OS but can't, you might
want to take a look at 'stdhdr.h' and see if you can fix the problem
there.

Please send any patches you wish to be considered for the next gputils release, 
to one of the Project Administrators listed at sourceforge.

Win32 Support
=============

Although gputils was primarily intended for GNU systems, it can be compiled
on a win32 system (Win98, WinNT, ...).  This has been performed using the 
Borland C Compiler and Microsoft Visual C.

The gputils supported win32 compiler is MinGW.  It is available at:

http://www.mingw.org/

MinGW was selected because it is based on the GNU C compiler.  Additionally, 
it can easily be used as a cross compiler on GNU systems.

A native win32 version of MinGW is available.  However, the process for 
compiling on a win32 system has not been developed.  This will be provided 
some time in the future.

Until then, offical gputils ports to win32 will be generated using a cross 
compiler on a Linux system.  The following scripts will configure gputils to 
cross compile to win32 using a Linux system:

mkdir cross && \
cd cross && \
CC=i386-mingw32msvc-gcc ../configure \
  --srcdir=.. \
  --build=i586-pc-linux-gnu \
  --host=i386-mingw32msvc
