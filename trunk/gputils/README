This is a collection of development tools for Microchip (TM) PIC (TM) 
microcontrollers. It's intended to be compatible with the manufacturer's 
tools, MPASM, MPLINK,and MPLIB.

This is ALPHA software: there may be serious bugs in it, and it's
nowhere near complete.  gputils currently only implements a subset of
the features available with Microchip's tools.  See the documentation for 
an up-to-date list of what gputils can do.

Installation instructions are constained in the INSTALL document.

Documentation is in the "doc" directory.  The user manual is
"gputils.lyx", it's ready for a postscript printer as "gputils.ps" or
viewing using Adobe (TM) Acrobat (TM) as "gputils.pdf".  Lyx is
available from http://www.lyx.org

Send any bug reports to the bug tracking system at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/gputils/

Please verify a bug report has not already been submitted before creating a
new one.  In the report, please state which version of gputils you're using, 
the machine and OS you've built it for (or not), and enough source code to 
reproduce the problem.

If you're trying to build gputils on a machine/OS but can't, you might
want to take a look at 'stdhdr.h' and see if you can fix the problem
there.

Please send any patches you wish to be considered for the next gputils release, 
to one of the Project Administrators listed at sourceforge.
