/*
 * .cod definitions
 *
 * A .cod file consists of an array of 512 byte blocks. There are two types
 * of blocks: a "directory" block and a "data" block. The directory block
 * describes the miscellaneous stuff like the compiler, the date, copy right
 * and it also describes the type of information that's available in the .cod
 * file. The "type of information" is specified by a range of blocks. For
 * example, if there are symbols in the .cod file then the directory block
 * tells the starting and ending blocks that contain the symbols.
 *
 * Types of data blocks:
 * short symbol table - a list of symbols in the "short format", which
 *     means that the symbol name is restricted to 12 characters. This
 *     is an old format and is not provided by gpasm.
 * long symbol table - a list of symbols in the "long format". Like the
 *     short symbol table except the symbol names can be up to 255 chars.
 * list table - a cross reference between the source line numbers, list
 *     line numbers, and the program memory.
 * Memory map table - describes the ranges of memory used in the processor.
 * Local variables table - [c files - not supported by gpasm] this describes
 *     the memory locations used by functions.
 * Source file names - a list of the files used to assemble the source file.
 * Debug messages - [not supported by gpasm] this provides a list of messages
 *     that can control the simulator or emulator.

/*
 * Here's a list of the offsets for the directory block. In each case the
 * offset is the number of bytes from the beginning of the block. Note that
 * it would be much more clever to alias a properly sized structure onto the
 * block. However, without using compiler dependent flags, it's not possible
 * to control how the data members of a structure are packed. Portability 
 * has its costs.
