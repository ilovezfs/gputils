                         gplink test scripts

This directory contains the files and scripts for testing gplink.  The 
complete set of tests should be ran before each release.  

Please don't modify an existing test file.  Modifying the file will reduce 
its effectivness in regression testing.  It is better to create a new file that
tests the new/untested feature. 

I.  Usage

To run the complete test suite:

  ./test all &> test.log
  
This will test all tools and output the result to the file "test.log".  It
should always be reviewed.

for more information 

  ./test help

II.  Test structure

The files can come from a varitey of sources.

/gpasm.project

This directory contains gplink tests written by the project.

III.  Adding new tests.

Here are the basic steps:

  1.  Write the asm files.
  2.  Write the linker file.
  2.  Assemble and link.
  3.  Manually verify the output.
  4.  Place the the files in their respective subdirectories in ./project.
  
The script will automatically find the files and test them.  

IV. The Future.

This directory structure should support dejagnu.  The tests will be converted
sometime in the future.  At that time the test files will probably be 
distributed as part of gputils, to allow users to easily test new ports.  
Unfortunately, this will double the size of the package, but it should still
be under 1 MB.
