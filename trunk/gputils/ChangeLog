  * reformat ChangeLog  

0.9.12   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  The preprocessor now supports #v(expression) substitution in labels and 
symbols.  If symbol equals 4, then the label "mylabel_#v( (symbol * 3))_ok" is 
replaced with "mylabel_12_ok".

2.  The error message "can't evaluate expression" has been replaced by more
specific error messages.

3.  eeprom8 device is now supported.

4.  The DOS newlines option (-n) has been disabled on win32 systems.  DOS
newlines are already the default on these systems.

0.9.11   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  Labels are substituted when found on the #define table.  

2.  Labels are treated as macros when found on the macro table.

3.  gpasm can now distinguish between directives and opcodes placed in the 
first column.  

4.  defines are now printing in the listing file symbol table.

5.  #ifdef and #ifndef check the entire symbol table not just #define table.

6.  Several processors had characters with the incorrect case in the 
defined_as section of their definition.  This lead to incorrect warnings when
using the Microchip header files.

7.  Some changes have been incorporated for cross compiling to win32 systems.

0.9.10   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  The instruction set is now loaded when the processor is selected.
Previously it was loaded when the first instruction is encountered.  This 
resolves some old problems when the first instruction is incorrectly formatted.  

0.9.9   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  Labels are now checked against the symbol tables.  If the label is found
on the instruction or the directive lists, a warning is generated and the text 
is treated accordingly.

2.  Symbols may now be assigned values when declared using the local directive.
As in "local i, j=15, k".

3.  The extended ASCII character set (ü) may now be used for labels and 
symbols.  

4.  gpasm now tests for infinite while loops.  In this condition, an error is
generated and assembly continues. 

5.  Assembly will now stop upon encountering the first END statement. 
Regardless of location.

6.  Flags have been added to the linker to warn when a common symbol is 
combined with another symbol.  This condition could create porting issues. The 
warnings that resulted from this change were fixed.  

0.9.8   TSD for Craig Franklin

1. Macros and While loops are now expanded in the listing file.  Macro 
expansion can be disabled using "list e=OFF" in the source code or "-e OFF" as 
a gpasm argument.  While loops are always expanded.    

2. Macros and While loops are also expanded in the COD file.  Now when you 
step through the source code in gpsim, the file viewer will jump to the macro 
or while loop definition.

3.  New Processors added:

     16c745, 16c765

4.  Some users require dos style new lines (CRLF) in hex files for device 
programmers.  gpasm will generate these by selecting -n or --dos. 

5. The -Wall and -pedantic flags were added to gcc on linux systems.  All 
warnings generated from this change were corrected.  

6. Various configuration problems were fixed that caused "make distcheck" to 
fail.

7. getopt_long() has been added to gpvo.

8. A Makefile for generating rpms has been added.  See the README in the rpm
subdirectory for details.

9. BUG #433291. During macro innvocation, the list linetype was set to the 
value of the line before endm in the definition.  This could result in a bad
label error, if that line was a non code generating directive.  The linetype is
now "none" during expansion or "insn" during nonexpansion. 

0.9.7   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  The i++ and i-- operators are now implemented.  Note: the variable is a
label and must appear in column 1. 

2.  +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, |=, and ^= have all been implemented.
Note: the variable is a label and must appear in column 1. 

3.  If a file ends during an IF statement, before an ENDIF found, a warning is 
now generated.

4.  The conditional assembly directives IFDEF, IFNDEF, and ENDIF may now be
proceeded by a "#".  example: #ifdef

5.  The SET directive may now be proceeded by "."

6.  The header files have been updated. 

7.  A memory map is now generated as part of the listing file.  The generation
of the memory map is controlled by "list mm=[ON|OFF]".

8.  The number of program words used by the program is now reported in the
listing file.

9.  Several users have had problems linking with libfl.a to get yywrap().  
gpasm has been modified so that libfl.a is no longer needed.  flex is still 
required.

10.  The message generated whenever a special mneumonic was used has been
disabled.  This message was part of the test files provided by Microchip, but
message is not yet part of the current mpasm releases. 

11.  The configure script now detects the host operating system.  When using cc
on SunOS the "-xCC" flag is used to allow "//" comments.

12.  New processors added:

     18c601, 18c801, 18f010, 18f012, 18f020, 18f022

0.9.6   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  A new utility, gpvo, GNU PIC View Object, was added.  This tool displays the
contents of Microchip's object files.  The tool is in a very preliminary stage 
of development.  To reflect this it is designated "pre-alpha".  

2.  BUG #426330.  getopt_long() is not available on all systems.  The configure
script now detects the function.  If it is not present gpasm uses getopt(). 
This does not change the features available, only the way they are commanded.

3.  To make the error messages more readable the error codes are now enclosed in
[].

4.  BUG #423850.  gpasm would hang on symbols defined incorrectly. 

          #define foo foo.  
 
crash --> movlw foo

An error is now generated each time foo is used in an expression and gpasm
doesn't lockup.

5.  1/2 of BUG #423204.  The top level assembly file must always end in "END". 
This condition is now tested for and an error is generated if it is not present.    

6.  BUG #422060.  gpasm will now compile on a 64 bit machine (NetBSD/Alpha is
the only one that has been tested).     

7.  gpvc header file had declarations that were getting instantiated multiple
times.

0.9.5   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  gpasm, like mpasm, is now case sensitive by default.  The -c parameter now 
makes gpasm case insensitive.

2.  The macros in special.inc have been incorporated into the source code.  This
was done to solve a case sensitivity problem.

3.  gpdasm can now read inhx16 format in addition to inhx8m and inhx32.

4.  A new option, -i, has been added to gpdasm.  This option returns data on 
the input hex file, like number of bytes and hex file format.

5.  The format of error/warning/message has been changed.  To standard output
the new format is 

  "filename":"line number": Error "number" "message"

to the list file:

  Error ["number"] : "message"

The list file output conforms with MPASM.  The standard output conforms with
most gnu tools.

6.  GNU long options have been provided by Salvador Eduardo Tropea
<salvador@inti.gov.ar>. 

0.9.4   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  inhx16 hex format can now be generated by gpasm.  

2.  17cxx devices are now checked for exceeding their 16 bit address range.  If
this happens an error is generated.

3.  gpasm now checks to see if an address has been written to more than once.  
If it has an error is generated.

4.  Previously, when an invalid data memory location is accessed, gpasm would
generate a warning and not write the instruction to program memory.  Now it 
will still generate the warning, but it also outputs the instruction.

5.  __fuses is now equivalent to __config.

6.  The 16c461 processor has been added.

7.  When two different processors are selected in the source file an error,
in addition to the duplicate processor warning, is generated.

8.  The "#" symbol can now be prefixed to include directives.

9.  If a source file ends during a while statement, before a endw is
encountered, an error is generated.

10.  Bug #413296.  Numeric expressions followed by b, d, h, or o, are now 
interpretted according to the radix they represent (i.e. 144o = 144 octal 
= 100 decimal)

11.  Labels are now checked to verify they are on a legal line.  An example is
shown below: 

     Error radixerr.asm 16 : 121 Illegal label.
                    00016 Label   RADIX   OCTAL

0.9.3   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  The 17cxx processor family is now supported.  Much of the work was completed
by Carlos Nieves <cnieves@iname.com>.

2.  Macro name case sensitivity is now controlled by the -c option.

3.  Values stored to program memory using the dt directive are now masked to
ensure that a value over 0xff isn't stored.

4.  The number of arguments passed to EXPAND and NOEXPAND are now checked.  If
any number other than 0 is passed a warning is generated.

5.  If no arguments are passed to SPACE, it is now equivalent to SPACE 0.

6.  16cr56 and 14000 processors are now supported.  

7.  SUBTITL and STITLE are now equivalent to the SUBTITLE directive. 

8.  A single character enclosed by double quotes is now interpretted as the
corresponding ASCII code (example: ANDLW "A" = 0x0E41 for 12 bit cores).

9.  The header files have been updated.

10.  The ram access bit "a" for 18cxx devices now defaults to "0" or Access RAM.

11.  The AND operator now has a higher precedence then the OR operator.  The
following line from the preced.asm test file demonstrates this.

    002D     0000           00067         DATA    2 == (2 && 0 + 1)       ; 0
                            00068 
--> 002E     0001           00069         DATA    1 || 0 && 0     ; 1
    002F     0001           00070         DATA    1 || (0&&0)     ; 1
    0030     0000           00071         DATA    (1||0) && 0     ; 0

12.  A few changes were required to compile under Mac OS X.  Some of these 
changes were incorporated.

0.9.2   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  Added many new processors.  The new list is below:

	gen        p12c508    p12c508a   p12c509    p12c509a   p12c671

	p16c924    p16ce623   p16ce624   p16ce625   p16cr54    p16cr54a
	p16cr54b   p16cr54c   p16cr56a   p16cr57a   p16cr57b   p16cr57c
	p16cr58a   p16cr58b   p16cr62    p16cr63    p16cr64    p16cr65
	p16cr72    p16cr83    p16cr84    p16f83     p16f84     p16f84a

	p18c242    p18c252    p18c442    p18c452    p18c658    p18c858
	sx18       sx20       sx28       

2.  Bug #231274.  Page directive conflicted with the Page instruction in sx 
devices.  The result was a redefining symbol error when an SX device was 
selected.  This has been fixed.  The result is the PAGE directive is disabled 
for all SX devices.

3.  Config data is now masked by the device core size.  This prevents things
like 0x1234 from being written into config memory for a 12 bit device. 

4.  "decimal" and "octal" are now valid arguments for the radix.  This is a
legacy feature of MPASM.  It is not documented in their users manual. 

5.  In instances of "label org 100", label is added to the symbol table. 
Previously, it was ignored.

6.  BUG #233207.  Labels defined inside macros now work.

7.  Microchip has provided the gpasm project with test files they use to test 
MPASM.  The new test files have been added to CVS.  These files required the 
use of their header files.  These were added to the project.  They are 
installed when "make install" is ran.

8.  The distribution now includes an example located in ./examples/example1.

9.  A few changes were required to compile under cygwin.  Some of these changes
were incorporated.

10.  Cleaned up source code.  (Missing comments, unused code, ...) 

0.9.1   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  The project was reorganized to make room for some new tools. Each tool    
is now located in its own subdirectory.  Common functions are located in 
libgpasm.a in the lib directory.

2.  A new utility, gpdasm, GNU PIC Disassembler, was added.  Details can be 
found in the project documentation.  

3.  A new utility, gpvc, GNU PIC View COD, was added.  Details can be 
found in the project documentation.  This is basically version 0.0.3 of Scott
Dattalo's vc.  It will be maintained as part of gpasm. 

4.  Documentation has been updated.  The gpasm section includes changes made
during the 0.8.x series.  It still isn't perfect. It is missing information on
the PIC18cxx series.  New sections have been added for the new tools.

5.  Previously, the ERRORLEVEL directive required the user to force
interpretation of arguments as decimal using "." or "d".  This is no longer
required.  The arguments are always interpreted as decimal regardless of the
radix setting.

6.  A debug message has been removed from the maybe_evaluate function in
opcode.c.

0.9.0   TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  A typo in the help listing for the usage of warning level was fixed. 

2.  The options for LIST are case sensitive when the -c option is used.  Because
of this, list p=<XXX> works and list P=<XXX> doesn't.  This has been corrected.

3.  The addition of the case sensitive defines broke the processor selection
using -p <processor>.  This has been fixed.

4.  gpasm -q will now suppress the output from the gperror system to the screen.
This doesn't effect the listing file.  It doesn't currently make gpasm totally
quiet.  Some messages bypass the gperror system.  They are not effected by -q.

5.  gpasm reported an "Unknown Opcode" for each instruction whenever a processor
wasn't selected.  It now reports this error as "Processor type is undefined". 


0.8.16  TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  New directives:

     da
     __idlocs
     variable
     constant
     
2.  The data and db directives generated incorrect values for 16 bit cores. 
This has been corrected.

3.  The dw directive generated incorrect values for all devices.  This as been
corrected.

4.  inhx8s hex format can now be generated.

5.  EXPAND and NOEXPAND directives can now be called without generating an
error.  They will not, however, effect the listing file.  Similarly, macro 
expansion can be selected on the command line with "gpasm -e [ON|OFF]" or
using in the source file "list x=[ON|OFF]."  They will not effect the listing
file.

0.8.15	TSD for Craig Franklin

1.  When numeric arguments were passed to a function that expects a symbol,
GPASM reported the error as "Expression to Complex".  This has been changed to
illegal argument to conform with MPASM.  

2.  A previous patch always warned the user then option or tris was used.  I
have learned that MPASM doesn't warn the user on p16c5x devices.  The behavior
has been modified to conform with MPASM.

3.  The -c option now makes the #defines case sensitive.

4.  Command line setting of the warning level is supported.  Like MPASM, 
command line arguments override settings in the source code. All command 
line settings now have flags indicating the value was set by the 
command line and it can't be overwritten by the asm source code.  A warning 
or message is posted to the user.

5.  Output hex file format can now be chose using LIST f=<inhx8m|inhx8s|inhx32>.  

6.  GPASM 0.8.14 has a bug were the org isn't reset after a config is called. 
This is normally not seen because most people place the config statements before
their first org.  This patch saves the org before the config is ran then 
restores it afterword.

7.  GPASM 0.8.14 doesn't print the config information to the list file correctly
for pic18cxx devices. 

8.  Several new codes have been added for new tests.

9.  The FILL directive works.  It works the same as MPASM with one important 
exception.  It does't support the use of a line of assembly as an argument.  
That is not a problem because the while statement can do the same thing. 

10.  GPASM now generates inhx32 format.  In adding this, a structural change had 
to be made.  Previously, the MEMBLOCK segment size was 64K words.  I changed 
this to 32K words.  I did this because the 32K words (or 64K bytes) is equal 
to one segment.  Which, conviently, is the maximum size for a inhx8m file and
the size of one inhx32 segment.

11.  The list file had some extra blanks.  These were fixed.

12.  All of the directives and instuctions now have the correct list linetype 
assignment.  I abandoned the default method because of too many special cases.

13.  The RADIX directive had a linetype assignment of ORG, it should be none.

14.  The ORG directive originally had the correct line type assignment of ORG. 
It was changed to EQU in version 1.8 of opcode.c.  I don't know the reason.  
This patch changes it back.

15.  The PAGE directive had a linetype assignment of ORG, it should be NONE.

16.  Directives in scan.l (include, define, ..) are now all case insensitive.
There are many instances in microchips appnotes of SubTitle, Title, ...
GPASM 0.8.14 dosesn't recognize them.  The change was to add "-i" to flex
when GPASM is compiled this makes the scan.l case insensitive.

17.  #undefine now works.  Previously symbols could be redefined by having
another instance of #define.  Doing so will now result in a warning.  Symbols
must be defined and undefined and defined again to be reassigned.

18.  Previously, #define could only appear in column 1.  Now it does not. This
occurs in micorchip include files.  

19.  Previously, #defines were executed regardless of assembling being enabled. 
An example would be a set of defines inside an IF statement.  This case occurs
when Micorchip's include file for 16c5x devices is used.

0.8.14	TSD Yet another patch from Craig Franklin that improves gpasm error
	handling capabilities. Also, I added the 16f876 for Alex Holden.

0.8.13  ELS - Added gpasm.spec file to build RPMs under Red Hat Linux 7.0,
	use 'rpm -ta gpasm-0.8.13.tar.gz'.  Added missing newline to
	gperror.h.

0.8.12	TSD Patch from Craig Franklin mailto:craigfranklin@users.sourceforge.net that 
	implements the ERRORLEVEL directive.

0.8.11  TSD Patch from Craig Franklin mailto:craigfranklin@users.sourceforge.net to fix command
	line options (the -o option was missing, and the -e and -w options weren't
	being used). Also applied patch from Craig that implements the subtitle 
	directive.

0.8.10	TSD added support for more than 8 files in one .cod file.

0.8.6  symbol information was not being written to the .cod file

0.8.5 
  added >64k file generation capability. 
  added support for the __CONFIG address, config_bits directive
    (you used to couldn't specify the config address)
  added i_memory.c to handle the instruction memory. Previously,
    i_memory was a 64k, statically allocated array. Now it's a
    dynamically allocated linked list of 64k memory blocks.
  redesigned/rewrote major portions of cod.c to accomodate the
   greater than 64k code generation. Removed the unnecessary
   restriction that the miscellaneous code blocks had to be
   written in a specific order. Added multiple directories.
   Fixed the code range information (this specifies where there's
   valid code).  
   
0.8.1 - 0.8.4
  minor enhancements 

0.8.0

 - added a few more processors
 - the HIGH directive was always returning 0
 - __CONFIG directive now supports an optional address
 - added support for >64k address space
   (this allows the 18cxxx config word to be handled
    properly, but at the same time the change is 
    general enough to accomodate code generation
    at addresses above 64k - a feature gpsim will
    soon need).
 - Switched the Makefile to a more standard automake
   style.
 - Changed the number notation so that what was the
   micro version is now the minor version. Development
   releases will bump the micro version. (This means
   gpasm-0.0.8 is now expressed as gpasm-0.8.0).
 - renamed gpasm.y to parse.y so that the automake
   tools would be happy.
 - Enhanced the error message system.

0.0.8

Added SET opcode
Supports '=' syntax for SET
Added WHILE/WEND
Added ERROR
Added 'generic' processor type; needed for AVR support

Support for .cod files added 
  - added cod.c and cod.h
  - several small changes scattered through out all of the source
    some of the more significant changes:
     o modified the state structure to accomodate symbol files
     o gpasmVal now has typing information
     o cblock defined constant are given register typing
     o program labels are given typing info

Added a few more pic processors

__config now will display the config address and config value in the .lst file

dt macro didn't ignore upper 8 bits of a literal

added new macros:
  db   byte packed data table
  dw   same as data macro
  de   like dw but upper nibble is zeroed

Added support for the 18cxxx instruction set.
Added the '-l' (dash ell) option for showing the list of
supported processors


0.0.7

Tab-stops now expanded to spaces in listing, LIST b=NN supported
Scenix processors added
Changed sys_errlist[] to strerror()
Manual update

0.0.6

Build using autoconf

0.0.5

Fixed bug where we always processed equ statements, even inside
conditional assembly blocks.

0.0.4

Second invocation of macro actually runs the macro twice, so local
forward definitions get resolved correctly.  This means that macro
bodies get 3 passes made on them.  Far from pretty, but it does the
job.  See execute_macro(), and new function execute_body().

Restore cblock value to 0 at start of 2nd pass.

Accept CBLOCK headers without an expression: continues at previous
CBLOCK value.  See gpasm.y.

Accept CBLOCK values as labels, with or without an expression.  See gpasm.y.

Do #define substitution.  Done in the lexical analyser, using the same
stack that we use for include files.  Still no support for parameters
in #define.  See scan.l.

Evaluate '$' late, instead of at parse time.

Missing parameter to bit operations was giving coredump instead of
error message.

Makefile now builds with "gcc -Wall --pedantic", had a general cleanup
following this.

Small fix to lexical analyser to make it cope with MSDOS '\r'
characters.
