list is in no particular order.

gputils
  * grep the source for FIXME and fix.
  * Add a check for the version of flex.
  * Start migrating to the GNU coding style.
  * Prefix all visible library functions with gp_. Add _ to all 
    others.
  * Switch to xmalloc and obstacks.
  * Use dejagnu for testing.

gpasm
  * Implement nested while loops.
  * Clean up the byte verses word, data memory/program memory stuff.
  * Move opcode generator from /gpasm/directive.c to 
    /libgputils/opcode.c.
  * Move COD file generation to library.
  * Add macro names to symbol table in listing file.
  * Undefined coff symbols are always at the end of the coff table.
  * Add relocations for the difference between symbols in the same section.
  * Allow multiple symbols with the same name in different sections of COFF
    asm files.
  * Allow expressions in .direct.  Reduce to operators, numbers, and controls.

gplink
  * Removed unnecessary page and bank switches.
  * Peep-like optimization.  Consider using pcode from sdcc-pic14.
  * Partial linking.
  * Use extended COD file types.

gpvc
  * Use the disassembler to decode the program memory sections.

gpprocessor.c
  * Coff_type of the pic18lf47k40 bogus. (Microchip error in the MPLABX-3.15, original value is 0x0000.)
    Temporarily fixed to 0xFFFF.
